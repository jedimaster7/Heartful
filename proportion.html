          <h5>Proportion</h5>

          <p>Which of those titles really stuck out to you? Was it the large one at the top with the wide margin around it, or was it the smallest one wedged in between another title and this paragraph? I'm hoping you said the first one, of course if you said the little one then maybe a career in detective work is for you. Now an important clarification to make: proportion does not mean big or small, proportion is the <em>relative</em> size of one object compared to others. An amoeba looks massive next to a little bacterium, but you can't see either of those with your naked eyes. I like making pictures, so here's an example of proportion. </p>

          <p>(insert picture here)</p>

          <p>Notice how there's a gigantic circle in the middle compared to the other ones? Of course you did, because that's what proportion does for you. Proportion can be between objects, parts of an object, or even the entire artwork. Proportion can show importance, such as the main character on a movie poster might be the largest. Proportion can also be used to help someone understand the sheer size of something, like putting a human next to a blue whale, just so you realize how large they are. Proportion can also produce other effects such as feelings of helplessness or being overwhelmed, maybe by portraying an invader as a massive bully gripping your country in its fist. </p>

          <p>Proportion is also present everywhere. I know I used this in an earlier lesson, so I won't repeat it, but Fibonacci's sequence can be used to find the Golden Ratio, or the perfect proportion, which is used in artwork and even when it comes to human attractiveness. In this case, the proportion of various features of the body or face can be considered more or less attractive by different people. As you can see proportion plays a big part in art and design, even in web and video game design. </p>
