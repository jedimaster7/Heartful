    <h1>Pattern</h1>

    <p>Pattern is the repetition of elements in a recurring sequence. A pattern can be composed of recurring shapes or elements, even colors. Whether you realize it or not, pattern is all around you. From the tartan of your neighbor's kilt to the Greek meander on your mom's favorite China, pattern is present in nearly all art forms. Let's think about a very simple example, a series of boxes, such as the ones below. There is a pattern because every third box is the same, creating a pattern of three boxes which are repeated.</p>

    <p>Pattern isn't restricted to manmade artworks alone. Pattern can be found prolifically in nature. Take for example the spots on a cheetah. We call that a pattern because it is quite repetitive. It isn't a perfect pattern because each spot is unique, so there is no repetition, however, to the observer it appears repetitive. How about we look at a very nice pattern. The Fibonacci sequence. The Golden Formula, which can be found in a plethora of areas, from the humble pinecone to the sea shell, dictates many patterns in nature. Let's look at its beautiful form.</p>

    <p><span class="math">\[F_n=\frac{\varphi^n-\Psi^n}{\varphi-\psi}\]</span></p>

    <p>Boom. Beautiful. That's all the art you need to know. I kid, but in case you wanted it there's the Fibonacci sequence formula. Just look it up on Wikipedia if you want to know what the Greek letters stand for. Anyway, my point is that pattern is all around us, from the natural world to the artworks we make. It can be represented in art in a variety of ways, from meandering lines to simple things, such as dots repeating. Pattern is beautiful and pattern is nearly omnipresent.</p>
