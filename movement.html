    <h1>Movement</h1>

    <p>Movement is the artist's connection with time. By conveying movement into an artwork, an artist can bring time into something that is frozen in time. Movement can present itself in a variety of ways, from the poses of the characters to motion blurs,
      or even odd positions of objects that suggest it is moving.</p>

    <p>Movement can be either literal or compositional. What I mean by that is you can paint a runner and show a motion blur or the runner in a running position, in which case your are adding motion in literally, the character is actually supposed to be
      moving. You can also make movement compositional, in which you cause the viewer's eyes to move across the artwork. For example, a series of lines could flow towards a common spot on the artwork, causing your eyes to follow them until the end.</p>

    <p>We also find movement in three dimensional artworks. Cars have flowing lines that while they help with aerodynamics, are also very aesthetically pleasing. A sculptor could carve a statue of an athlete and have them in the position that indicates movement.
      </p>

    <p>Compositional movement can be achieved with multiple tools. You can use lines and curves to cause someone's eyes to move across the page. You can also place things off balance, or use changes of color and pattern to cause movement. For literal movement
      you can use blurs or positions that indicate movement is in progress. Lastly, there are two types of compositional movement; static, in which your eyes jump from part to part, and dynamic, in which your eyes smoothly glide over the artwork. Below
      are some examples of how compositional movement can be achieved.</p>
