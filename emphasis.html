    <p>What happens when we put <strong>EMPHASIS</strong> on something? Well your eyes kind of jump to it, or you become alert if the person whispering next to you suddenly <strong>SHOUTED</strong> in your ears. Well it's the same for art. Lets think of
      a simple scenario. I am an artist, I want to paint something that conveys my feelings about a certain politician, book antagonist, or whomever I don't like. Well then I might <em>emphasize</em> their faults. If you've ever been to a fair or an amusement
      park then I'm sure you've seen this before, a caricature.</p>

    <p>Now it doesn't necessarily have to be the emphasis on certain facial features of a person, you could be emphasizing any object in a painting, be it something like a lone flower in a sad and grey field, or one of two circles in a minimalist painting.
      Take the following image for example; what part of it draws your gaze to it? Is it the big, black circle in the middle?</p>

    <p>You see, emphasis can be accomplished multiple ways. Like the above example we can use size to emphasize something, such as making the circle big, or making someone's nose or eyebrows unrealistically large. Likewise we can also use color for emphasis.
      Imagine a painting in which there are several dozen circles all of the same size, but while the majority are greyscale, one is bright pink. If you are too lazy to imagine this I've included an image below, and yes I am aware that there are not several
      dozen circles in the image, I got lazy. Now before I close this paragraph I want to mention something; <strong>subordination</strong>. Subordination is when you deemphasize objects in order to place emphasis on something else. This means that rather
      than making an object large and brightly colored, you can <em>simply make everything around it small and grey</em>. Think about the aforementioned example with the flower in a grey field.</p>

    <p>Emphasis can also be accomplished through value, which is the scale from light to dark. Below you'll find a sequence of rectangles all grey, but the value of each places emphasis even though they are all the same size. Lastly, and I've included this
      in the below image, you can also use focal point to emphasize something.</p>
