<p>Alright, in this lesson it's time to break out the rhythm. I like to think that I have rhythm. Anyway, you may be thinking, &quot;Doesn't rhythm have to do with music?&quot; Well you'd be right in thinking that. Rhythm is a part of music. Rhythm is a part of us all. Rhythm moves your soul. LOL. But Rhythm is also a part of art. It's basically the same as in music. Let's think about that. Let's say I make a simple electronic drum beat. I only use a kick and a snare. Try and visualize a kick every note and a snare every quarter-note. Your visualization could be rhythm in art. It's basically the same thing in art. Let's imagine I paint a picture of a river, I can paint lily pads in a way that conveys a sense of rhythm, they are equally distributed apart. Rhythm can be complex or it can be simple, it can be a modern artwork with flowing lines and differing colors that create an upbeat feel, or it can be a countryside with gently rolling hills. Rhythm is another way in which visual media can invoke feeling.
