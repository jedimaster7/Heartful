          <p>Repetition. Repetition. Repetition. That's an example of repetition. When something happens over and over again. In the last lesson we spoke about patterns, well patterns are basically a form of repetition. Different repeating elements can produce a pattern. You can have objects repeat, shapes, or even series of shapes repeat. Even within an object, a part of it can be repeated. Take for example a series of buttons on the side of a TV, they aren't usually all different sizes and colors, usually they are uniform. Let's look at a simple repetition below.</p>

          <p>(insert image here)</p>

          <p>As you can see in the above image, there is a pattern, which is caused by repetitive elements, namely, the alternating black and grey squares. Having one object might makes a scene more lonely, and isolated, or bring focus to the only object. Using repetition you can also bring focus to something. If you made a painting with five thousand dragons in the middle you might think that the dragons are important to the artwork. Going back to the ten thousand dragons (it was five thousand, just checking to see if you're paying attention), a large number of dragons might make you feel powerless. If you've seen Game of Thrones Season 7 then you know what just one dragon can do. Paint one lonely soldier surrounded by an endless horde and you might find yourself rooting for the underdog. Likewise, repetition can be used to symbolize strength in numbers and unity. And of course, lack of repetition can be used to convey loneliness and solitude. </p>
