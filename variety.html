          <p>Variety. What can I say about variety? Variety is pretty straightforward. If you have one grey circle in the middle of a white background you don't have much variety, and that's not a bad thing, but if you want variety you simply increase the number of circles and their size variations, or add more colors. There are so many ways to create variety. You can use different sizes, different colors, different shapes, different objects, even different ways of presenting objects. Now why is variety important? Well if you wanted to convey a sense of unity and solidarity, you wouldn't want much variety, perhaps objects may be different, but they'd all have a unifying characteristic, like same shape but different colors. If you wanted to convey differences and a plethora of options that add variety. Even add variety if you try to convey discord and chaos in your artwork.</p>
