Balance is pretty easy to understand. Sit on a see-saw with no one on the other end and you'll sink to the floor and have a very lame day at the park. Art isn't much different. Put everything on one side of a painting and it'll seem unbalanced (not counting the weight of the paint). Of course, it's art and you can do whatever you want to, I often remember one of my English teachers who told me that once you know the rules of English you can break them. This was after I remarked about the style of e e cumming's poems. But enough about English, back to art. 

Imagine you paint a black and white painting where there are a lot of little stick figures in one corner and absolutely nothing anywhere else on the painting. This is called asymmetric balance. It will definitely draw the attention of everyone that sees it to the corner with the stick figures. This kind of balance can really invoke a feeling of movement and gravitation towards that corner.

If you want everything to be balanced, that is called symmetric balance. In this way you paint in a way similar to balancing something in real life, the weights must be equal or the distance from the fulcrum must be different to compensate for it.

If you want to create rays of sunlight coming down from the heavens or ripples from a pond after a stone has struck, that's called radial balance. Things seem to radiate out evenly from a focus.

Even in chaos can everything seem balanced. Imagine trying to paint stars. They are not all the same, not the same size, not the same distance from each other, but the starry sky seems balanced. This is called mosaic balance. 

As you can see there are many types of balance in art, and it's important to know how to incorporate balance into your art work to invoke whatever feeling you are trying to invoke, as art is really about feeling something more than just seeing something. In your artwork, you can use whichever type of balance you want, or even all of them at the same time, it's all up to you.
