Color is all around us. From the beauty of the natural world to the man-made colors in everything we wear and use. In fact color is so powerful that marketing companies choose colors and color schemes to influence your actions and get you to buy their products. Art students have entire classes and textbooks on color theory and how to use and manipulate color. Obviously I'm not going to go that in depth, I'm not an art professional and I don't have that much room on this website, but let's start with the basics.

Light travels at various wavelengths that we perceive as colors. In our eyes we have three receptors for three types of wavelengths, red, green, and blue. These three colors are known as the primary colors of light, and by mixing these colors in various ways, we can create all the other 7 million colors we can see. (There are some people who can see 4 primary colors, they have a genetic mutation called tetrachromacy, but that's a story for another time). But we're talking about art right, not science?

I mentioned that the primary colors of light are red, green, and blue (it's actually how I made the colors for this website, by specifying the values for each color using the CSS property rgba(), where the a starts for alpha, or the transparency of the color). Likewise pigments have primary colors as well. When working with pigments (think paint) you can mix the three primary colors of pigments to create any other color. The three primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow (normally taught to kids as blue, red, and yellow). This brings us to our first color theory lesson... the color wheel.

The idea of the color wheel is pretty simple, you have a big wheel with the three primary colors equidistant from each other. (Note this diagram is not some arcane symbol or part of any ritual.)

Next we blend two colors together and produce the secondary colors, purple, orange, and green. We can continue this cycle to produce tertiary colors and so on.

The real magic comes when we use the color wheel to create color palettes. We can create color schemes from analogous colors, which are colors that are next to each other on the wheel, such as green and yellow, or orange and yellow. We can also create color schemes from complementary colors. Complementary colors are colors that are directly opposite each other on the color wheel, such as orange and blue, or red and green.
