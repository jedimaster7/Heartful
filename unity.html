          <p>Unity. Not the 3D game engine. Unity is when components of an artwork go well together. When they complement each other and together create a beautiful work of art. It's hard to explain unity, but think of all the previous lessons, rhythm and variety and proportion, anything can be used to create a feeling of unity. And what does unity convey? Well I think you already know that. Unity provides a sense of solidarity and harmony. It can make a design minimalist, focusing on a few elements or unifying themes rather than a hubbub of colors and patterns. Using a color scheme you can portray unity, or even with a characteristic pattern. Unity is essentially guided by a unifying theme or goal.</p>
